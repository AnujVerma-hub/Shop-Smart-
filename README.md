# Shop-Smart


## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce user behavior data and building a machine learning model to predict whether a user is likely to purchase a product or not based on their browsing and interaction patterns.

The dataset contains detailed user activity information such as:

Time spent on different types of pages

Month and weekend activity

Visitor and traffic-related attributes

The complete workflow includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature encoding, model training, and post-pruning of a Decision Tree to improve generalization performance.


## 🎯 Objective

To understand customer behavior using data analysis and build a Decision Tree Classifier that predicts:
- "Will user make a pruchase? (Yes/No)"
